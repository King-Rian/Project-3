# Text-to-Emoji Translator

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a neural network that translates phrases or sentences into sequences of emojis. The model would identify keywords and contextual meanings from the input text and map them to the most relevant emojis.

## Data Source
Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/emojinet/data)

EmojiNet is the largest machine-readable emoji sense inventory that links Unicode emoji representations to their English meanings extracted from the Web. EmojiNet is a dataset consisting of:

1. 12,904 sense labels over 2,389 emoji, which were extracted from the web and linked to machine-readable sense definitions seen in BabelNet
2. Context words associated with each emoji sense, which are inferred through word embedding models trained over Google News corpus and a Twitter message corpus for each emoji sense definition
3. Specification of the most likely platform-based emoji sense for a selected set of emoji (since emoji presentation is different on different platforms)

## Expected Outcomes
1. A functional text-to-emoji translator capable of interpreting and representing text with emoji sequences.
2. Insights into how emojis can succinctly convey textual meaning
